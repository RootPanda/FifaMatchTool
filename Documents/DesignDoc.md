FIFA MATCH TOOL

## 1 Design Considerations
The Fifa match tool must meet all the of the user and system requirements described in Requirements.md. In addition, the tool must closely align with the Fifa Team Flow Chart. 

### 1.1 Assumptions
- User has an Android smart phone
- Phone is operating with OS version 4.0 and greater

### 1.2 Constraints
- Developers are inexperienced Android developers
- The program will not actaully be implemented

### 1.3 System Environment
- Android OS v4.0 and greater

## 2 Architectural Design
The architecture provides the high-level design view of a system and provides a basis for more detailed design work. These subsections describe the top-level components of the system you are building and their relationships.

### 2.1 Overview
This section provides a high level overview of the structural and functional decomposition of the system. 

This application consists of a simple display in a loop that waits for events from the user. In particular, it is a highly linear program with a few control flow statements that are branched depending on the user input. There is no custom data structures in this program.

### 2.2 Rationale
Since the program is very simple, a simple architecture is used.

### 2.3 Conceptual (or Logical) View
Please see diagram 2_3-ConceptualView.odg.

## 3 Low Level Design

### 3.1 Class Diagram
Please see 3_1-ClassDiagram.odg.

### 3.2 Sequence Diagram
This diagram shows details of how and in which order objects within a component interact with one another.

### 3.3 Component Diagram
This diagram shows the other components your software product interacts with. For each external component, you should list the interfaces that your software shares with it.

If your system does not interact with any external components, you may skip this section.

## 4 User Interface Design
This section should provide the specific format/layout of the user interface of the system.
